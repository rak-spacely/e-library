          <p>
            Placid Projects Limited was founded in 2018 with a simple yet
            powerful vision: to make quality educational content accessible to
            everyone, regardless of their location or economic circumstances.
            Our founders, a diverse group of educators, librarians, and
            technology entrepreneurs, recognized that while information has
            never been more abundant, access to structured, curated learning
            materials remained a challenge for millions worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a collection of 500 public domain books has grown
            into a comprehensive digital library housing over 15,000 titles
            across dozens of subjects. We have partnered with independent
            authors, educational institutions, and publishers who share our
            commitment to open access education. Every book in our collection has
            been carefully selected, properly formatted, and optimized for
            digital reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Placid Projects serves over 2 million learners from 120
            countries. Students use our platform to supplement their coursework,
            professionals access it for career development, and lifelong
            learners explore new interests and hobbies. We have seen our books
            downloaded in rural villages with limited internet, in bustling
            urban libraries, and everywhere in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that education is the foundation of personal growth and
            societal progress. In a world where textbooks can cost hundreds of
            dollars and library access is not universal, we are working to level
            the playing field. Every download represents someone taking a step
            toward their goals, and that motivates us every day.

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>
              Our mission is to eliminate barriers to education by providing
              free, high-quality digital books and learning resources to anyone
              with an internet connection. We are building a global library
              without walls, where curiosity is the only requirement for access.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              We envision a world where knowledge flows freely, where a student
              in any country can access the same educational materials as their
              peers in the most privileged institutions, and where the pursuit
              of learning is limited only by imagination, not circumstances.

          <article>
            <h3>Accessibility First</h3>
            <p>
              We design our platform to be simple, fast, and usable on any
              device. Whether you are accessing us from a smartphone on a slow
              connection or a high-speed desktop, your experience matters. All
              our books are properly formatted, searchable, and compatible with
              screen readers.

            <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
            <p>
              While we are proud of our extensive collection, we do not add
              books just to inflate numbers. Every title is reviewed for
              accuracy, readability, and educational value. We curate, not just
              aggregate.

            <h3>Community Driven</h3>
            <p>
              Our users help shape our collection through download analytics,
              ratings, and requests. We regularly survey our community to
              understand what subjects and formats serve them best. Many of our
              best resources come from user suggestions.

            <h3>Transparency and Ethics</h3>
            <p>
              We clearly indicate licensing information for every book, respect
              copyright laws, and work only with authors and publishers who have
              granted appropriate permissions. We do not sell user data, and we
              are transparent about how our platform is funded, through donations
              and optional premium features.

          <p>
            Over 2 million learners have downloaded books from our platform
            since 2018. Our most downloaded book, Introduction to Computer
            Science, has been accessed over 50,000 times, helping countless
            individuals begin careers in technology. Students in 120 countries
            have used our materials to supplement their education, with
            particularly strong adoption in India, Nigeria, Brazil, Indonesia,
            and the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have partnered with 45 universities and more than 200 independent
            authors who have chosen to share their work through our platform.
            Seventy eight percent of our users report that our resources
            directly contributed to achieving an educational or career goal.
            Perhaps most meaningfully, 35 percent of our users live in areas
            where physical libraries are not easily accessible.
